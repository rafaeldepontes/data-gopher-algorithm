# Linked List

A linear data structure that contains a node if X information and a next, tail or head that stores the reference to the subsequent node.

The entry point of a linked list is called HEAD (normally a pointer to the first value of the linked list), usually we will or can see things like "NEXT" which in this case would be the reference to the next node on our list... If it does not exist then its NULL (or nil in this case.), we can also have the PREVIOUS (or PREV) that is a reference to the previous node on our list and there are cases which we can encounter a TAIL, the TAIL normally refers to the reference to the LAST node in or list.

There are **three** types of Linked Lists:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
