# Depth First Search | DFS

DFS stands for Depth First Search, an algorithm to traverse a tree where you go through all the Nodes as deep as possible before bracktracking. The preorder, inorder and postorder are DFS variations! As we are know which algorithm use recursion, which implicitly uses a call stack!

But as said previously the preorder, inorder and postorder are variations! The real DFS doesn't check if the node is higher or lower... none of those things actually, because there our tree is half-balanced! We can not say that our tree is fully balanced because we are not checking the depth...
