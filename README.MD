# Data-Gopher-Algorithm

This repo aims to help me practice my overall understanding of DSA using mainly golang and maybe a little bit of Rust...

I'll try to split each section into different directories.

## Special Mentions:

- Thanks to Augusto Galego for making available on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GutoGalego) multiple solutions to LeetCode algorithms that helped me understand some of the problems shown here.
